Note to Collaborators

I've just set down here some preliminary ideas about what we might discuss. My idea is just to get people together to meet each other and talk about what we're doing, what works, etc. Toward that end the topics need to be appealing, so please feel free to add/delete/change. I'm not attached to anything in particular.

#2015 AIA Roundtable
##Beyond Point & Click: Digital photography for the working archaeologist

Advances in digital photography hardware and software mean that even non-expert photographers can do some great things with their photos, on site, in the storerooms, and even back at home after the season is over. This roundtable will allow participants to discuss some of the things they are doing now, and some of the things they'd like to do. The goal is to share ideas and expertise.

Some possible topics:
* 3D reconstructions
* Overhead photos
* Photomosaics
* High-dynamic range photography (or exposure blending)
* Working with historic photos
